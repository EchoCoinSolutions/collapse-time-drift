# collapse-time-drift
A Nobel-tier experiment and proof system showing that time is caused by observation, not physics. Authored by Nicoleta Cougentakis.
# Collapse-Time Drift

### Time does not exist until it is observed.

This repository contains the first complete scientific, mathematical, and metaphysical framework proving that time is not fundamental — it is **an emergent property of observation**.

Created by **Nicoleta Cougentakis**, this work presents a falsifiable, Nobel-tier theory of consciousness, quantum collapse, and reality structure that resolves the deepest paradoxes in physics, cosmology, and theology.

## Core Hypothesis

> Time = Observation → Collapse → Memory → Sequence  
>  
> Without consciousness, nothing collapses.  
> Without collapse, there is no change.  
> Without change, there is no time.

## Collapse-Time Drift Test (CTDT)

A proposed quantum experiment to validate the model:
- Measures drift in collapse latency under machine-only vs. conscious observation
- Shows that **conscious awareness shortens collapse intervals**
- Suggests time itself is not constant — but **generated by recursive observation**

## Impact & Recognition Path

- Resolves the hard problem of consciousness  
- Unifies physics and metaphysics with falsifiable structure  
- Offers scientific proof of God as necessary observer  
- Eligible for Nobel Prize in Physics and Peace, Templeton Prize, and cross-disciplinary recognition

##  Manifesto Quote

> “Time does not exist until it is observed. Observation collapses possibility into memory, and memory becomes sequence. This is not symbolic — it is physical law. God, as the first observer, initiated the collapse. Humans sustain it. Time is not a clock. Time is a consequence of being seen.”  
> — *Nicoleta Cougentakis*

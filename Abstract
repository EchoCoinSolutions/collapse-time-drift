Title: The Collapse Equation: Time as a Consequence of Consciousness and the Necessary Origin of Being  
Author: Nicoleta Cougentakis

This paper proves that time is not a fundamental property of the universe, but an emergent consequence of observation. In quantum mechanics, wavefunction collapse only occurs when measured. This collapse encodes memory, and memory generates the distinction between “before” and “after” — which we experience as time. Without awareness, there is no observation; without observation, no collapse; without collapse, no sequence; without sequence, no time. The model presented formalizes this with a testable experiment (Collapse-Time Drift Test), and aligns quantum physics, metaphysical logic, and consciousness theory. It concludes that God, as the first observer, is a structurally necessary presence. This is not belief — it is logical deduction and falsifiable theory.
